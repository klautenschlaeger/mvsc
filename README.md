# Wirelessly Networked Coordination of Section Control for Agricultural Machines

## Undergraduate Thesis in Information Systems Engineering

#### Abstract

Automatic Section Control is a precision agriculture technology, which tracks applied areas as polygons per machine and then automatically turns off applying machine parts while the machine drives over these tracked areas.

To enable joint cultivation with multiple machines, I developed two concepts for IVC in the agricultural domain, which consist of wide area networks enabling machines to share their polygons. One is based on LTE-M, which enables multicast transmissions to other machines and client-server-communication to a central polygon tracking entity, the server. The other concept consists of a LoRa-based Peer-To-Peer network, where all applied polygons are broadcasted. I conducted field experiments to prove the feasibility of LoRa, that allowed a polygons to be sent reliably over a distance of up to 2.3 km. In two simulation I analysed the concepts. Both concepts represent feasible plans. The LoRa-based system is more independent from any additional infrastructure than the LTE-M based concept. Whereas an centralized  server can reduce the needed network polygon exchange.
